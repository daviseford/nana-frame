Hi everyone, we recently gave Nana a digital picture frame. It shows a constantly revolving slideshow. It's set up in her living room so she can see it.

Here's how it works.

When you text or email `nana@daviseford.com` with a picture (or multiple pictures), Nana will see them with a slight delay of about one minute.

The cool thing about this is that you can text or email `nana@daviseford.com` and she will automatically get the pictures! 

You can include that email address in a group text or email, or a single text or email.

Photo files will automatically be pulled out of the email/text and sent to her frame.

Below is some information on how it works:

+ The slideshow will check for new photos every minute.
+ Every time a new photo has been sent in, the slideshow starts at the beginning - starting with your new photo!
  + This is great if you're on the phone and want to show her a photo - send a text or email to `nana@daviseford.com` - she will get it within a couple of minutes.

+ I would suggest limiting yourself to a few photos per message.
  + A maximum of 20 per email is probably a good idea.
  + The idea is to send a few great photos, not every photo!

+ The photos are organized from newest to oldest - newest photos are shown first.

+ Nana likes beautiful landscapes and animals (birds, butterflies)
+ Photos of Granddaddy are great, but according to Mom she does tend to cry when she sees them, so not too many, please.

+ Don't send anything that you wouldn't want her to look at every day!

+ Videos are not supported. I might add that feature later but no promises.
+ Any text accompanying the email/text is ignored.
